"""This module implements the `OnnxYolov11Detection` wrapper class

The `OnnxYolov11Detection` class, which inherits from the `ObjectDetectionModel` interface,
provides a wrapper for the YOLOv11 object detection model using the onnx runtime.

Key functionalities include:
    - Provides a common interface for detections (via the __call__ method).
    - Loading the YOLOv11 model from a weights file path.
    - Preprocessing images and postprocessing detections.
    - Performing object detection on an image using the YOLOv11 model.
    - Converting the YOLOv11 model's output to a list of Detection objects.

These `Detection` objects encapsulate details about detected objects, including bounding boxes,
confidence scores, and potentially keypoints (if available in the model's output).

This approach simplifies the integration and usage of YOLOv8 within this program, promoting code
modularity and reusability.
