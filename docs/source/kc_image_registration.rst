Image Registration
==================

Introduction
############
No matter how vigilant the camera operator is, there will be some amount of distortion of the chart added by photography.  
These distortions cause the important document landmarks and data to be in different locations for every photograph of a chart.
Most commonly, these distortions come in the form of linear image deformations due to slightly off angle photography.

Therefore, the photographed image needs an alignment process to take place in order to ensure that the information on the document is in roughly the correct location.
This process is called "image registration" [#]_.
